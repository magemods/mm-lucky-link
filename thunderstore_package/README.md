# Lucky Link

Suddenly Link seems to have pretty good luck, winning every minigame from Doggy Racetrack to Dampé's digging game!

## Features
### Lucky Bombers Code

Somehow the Bombers code is always 1-2-3-4-5. What are the odds of that? Also the Bomber guard seems to accept any code. Maybe he forgot what it was?

### Lucky Dampé

Somehow Dampé always digs a flame even in dirt patches where you thought there wasn't one. Maybe Dampé is just tired of taking the elevator?

### Lucky Doggy Racetrack

Ruff! Somehow your dog always feels unstoppable. What's Mamamu Yan feeding these dogs anyway?

### Lucky Goron Race

Somehow you never get hit by other gorons and they seem a bit slower. Maybe they're just afraid to win against Darmani?

---

### Lucky Marine Research Lab

Somehow one fish always catches the food. Maybe one's just hungrier than the other?

### Lucky Ocean Spider House Masks

Somehow you always shoot the masks in the correct order. Maybe the Stalchildren just aren't very good at creating locks?

---

### Lucky Treasure Chest Shop

Somehow the maze always seems easy. Did the Treasure Chest Shop Gal rig it for you?

### Lucky Lottery Shop

Somehow you always win the lottery. Does Termina have Vegas?
